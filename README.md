This repository holds the course materials for Cloudera's Services
Enablement Boot Camp and FCE's internal boot camp.

If you've received this repo as a ZIP file via email, please follow
the instructions that were included to initialize your repo.  You
can make your GitHub repo Private or Public.  It does not matter
to the course which option you use.

<strong>NOTE</strong>: GitHub now lets you upload new files and
edit them online. Don't do this. Only use your GitHub repo to publish
your lab work.  Make sure at all times that the most recent version
of your work is on your laptop.

Make your instructors Collaborators on your GitHub repo. This
privilege lets them create pull requests on GitHub for your review.
If you're unfamiliar with `git`, consult with an instructor or
knowledgable neighbor to help you.

We will use GitHub's Issues feature to track your progress. For
each section, we'll ask you to create one Issue and use it to log
your progress. We will use GitHub Labels to mark the state of
each lab (e.g., started, submitted, evaluated). Finally, we'll use
GitHub's Milestones to categorize your lab and challenge work. 

In a large class, it may take time for an instructor to assist you.
If you have a lab problem, describe in your current Issue what the
problem is. Include the error message or stack trace in the Issue
dialog, or capture a screen that shows your cluster's condition.
You should do this anyway, but we know from experience most of you
will just try to work as fast as you can. :-)

Before you start lab work, make the following changes to your GitHub
repo settings:

* Add your collaborators under `Settings -> Collaborators`.
* Enable `Issues` under `Settings -> Options`. Click the `Features` box and check `Issues`.
* Click the `Issues` tab and the `Milestones` button
    * Create two milestones: `Labs` and `Challenges`
    * Set the deadlines for Thursday and Friday of the training week, respectively.
* Click the `Labels` button and change your labels as follows:
    * Leave the `bug` Issue as is
    * Change `duplicate` to `started`
    * Change `enhancement` to `submitted`
    * Change `help wanted` to `evaluated`
    * Leave the `invalid` Issue as is
    * Change `wontfix` to `incomplete`; set the label color to yellow (`#fbca04`).
    * Leave the `question` Issue as is

If you miss these steps, we'll open an Issue on your repo asking you to finish this work.
We won't review what you submit for labs until you resolve this.
